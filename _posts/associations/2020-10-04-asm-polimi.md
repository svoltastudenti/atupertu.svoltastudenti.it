  Officially recognised by Polimi on 28th November 2017 and sprouted up from an
  idea seeded two years before, ASM is the very first association of Muslim
  students in Italy, signed up in the most prestigious university of engineering
  on a national basis. Thanks to the efforts and perseverance of a small group
  of students with different backgrounds, this independent and non-profit
  association aims to target different areas in the Muslim student's academic
  career.


  It originated from the strong need of a solid institution that unifies the Muslims and provides a platform where they can openly express themselves and point out their exigences and problems in the academic life, trying to reduce the misconceptions about Islam and fostering and strengthening the muslim identity of the students along with integration."
