description: "Have you ever dreamt of founding your own startup? Have you always
  been fascinated by technology and innovation but never found the right friends
  to share the passion with? Have you ever thought university is focusing too
  much on theory and hard skills, and not enough on what's going on in the real
  world? Then join us! Entrepreneurship Club Polimi is the first Politecnico's
  students association supporting and creating a community of future
  entrepreneurs. The mission of our association can be summed up in a simple
  motto: LEARN, NETWORK, BUILD! LEARN: we will organise events, workshops,
  meetings, where you will find speakers, entrepreneurs and experts of the
  sector sharing their story and their knowledge with us. The first step is to
  build up the right skills needed to break into the entrepreneurial world!
  NETWORK: Good projects need different skills and backgrounds! We will give you
  the opportunity to enter a heterogeneous ecosystem where you will be able to
  share ideas and get in touch with future partners. Be part of our community!
  BUILD: Once you have foundations and the right network all you have to do is
  to make your idea come to reality. Work in team, define and scale up your
  project. We're ready to start! Don't miss our events, follow us:
